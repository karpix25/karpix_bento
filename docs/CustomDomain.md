# Custom domain

For most independence I encourage everyone to get their own domain that redirects to blento.app (with a CNAME redirect), to connect your custom domain, on blento.app click on your profile icon in edit mode (top right corner) and select "custom domain".

If you want to buy a domain, I suggest cloudflare, as they sell domains at-cost and for root domains (like domain.com instead of blento.domain.com), cloudflare also offers CNAME flattening.
